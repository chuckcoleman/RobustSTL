<!-- The following are the things to do
* get `l1.py` working in c++/c
* rewrite RobustSTL into c++/c
* design `toeplitz` function to return a toeplitz matrix from given R and C
* study about numpy functions and write them in c++/c
* after decomposition, create the `anomalize` function, which determines anomaly points



Notes

* cvxopt -> matrix() function creates a dense matrix.
	- matrix(A) : creates a matrix from the list A supplied
	- matrix(A, B) : creates a matrix of shape B with the list A suplied
	
 -->

 * TOEPLITZ isn't working as it should be. Need top fix it tomorrow asap.
